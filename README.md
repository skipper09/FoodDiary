# FoodDiary
A food diary for logging daily intake that uses USDA's db to calculate nutrient totals for the day.

I often tell my patients to log their daily food intake and then go back and calculate their nutrient totals using various websites that provide a nice GUI to USDA's nutrient database.

I thought I would make a food diary that automatically calculates nutrient totals based on what a user enters for the day.
